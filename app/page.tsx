            <p>
              Swastik is a purpose-built AI-driven financial optimization platform
              designed for modern enterprises operating under constant economic
              pressure. By combining large-scale data processing, intelligent
              automation, and adaptive learning models, Swastik enables businesses
              to move beyond reactive cost control toward continuous, intelligent
              financial optimization.

            <h2 className="font-bold mb-1">The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              Modern organizations operate across fragmented systems—ERPs,
              procurement tools, payroll platforms, and vendor ecosystems—creating
              financial blind spots. Manual reviews and static reports fail to
              capture real-time inefficiencies, resulting in cost leakage,
              delayed decisions, and missed optimization opportunities.

            <h2 className="font-bold mb-1">How Swastik Works</h2>
            <p>
              Swastik leverages machine learning models trained on financial
              behavior patterns to continuously analyze transactions, contracts,
              and operational spend. The system detects anomalies, benchmarks
              costs against historical and industry data, and applies predictive
              intelligence to recommend precise, context-aware optimizations
              before inefficiencies escalate.

          <div>
            <h2 className="font-bold mb-1">Business Impact</h2>
            <p>
              By embedding AI directly into financial workflows, Swastik delivers
              immediate operational clarity. Leadership gains real-time visibility
              into spend dynamics, finance teams reduce manual overhead, and
              managers receive actionable insights that align daily decisions
              with long-term financial strategy.

            <h2 className="font-bold mb-1">Measurable Value</h2>
            <p>
              Organizations using Swastik typically realize measurable savings
              within weeks of deployment. AI-driven vendor optimization,
              intelligent budget forecasting, and continuous spend monitoring
              create compounding financial benefits that strengthen margins and
              improve long-term resilience.

              management—from periodic review to continuous intelligence. By
